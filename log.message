Bugfixes in 4th working copy format code.

 * svnkit/src/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/internal/wc/admin/SVNXMLAdminArea.java
   (fetchEntries()): set SVNProperty.DEPTH attribute to SVNDepth.INFINITY for 
                     every entry, it's necessary for update to work properly
   (writeEntries()): check an entry attribute name for applicability with a
                     call to SVNAdminArea.isEntryPropertyApplicabe() to filter
                     out attributes from modern formats
