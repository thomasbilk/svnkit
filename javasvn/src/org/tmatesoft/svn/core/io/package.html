Provides the base classes and interfaces that represent a skeleton of that part of the <i>JavaSVN</i> low-level API that is 
used for i/o operations. The <code>JavaSVN</code> high-level API is certainly based on the low-level one where the main part
is this package. All the details of an implementation of this basis are left behind the interface since a user is more 
interested in the interface itself. 
<BR>
<BR>
<code>SVNRepository</code> is the central class in this package that provides the basic inerface to carry out the commands
followed by data interchanging between a client and an SVN server.

<BR>
For users familiar with the native Subversion source code it may be useful to know that the considerable part
of the package classes functionality is more or less similar to the <code><b>include/svn_ra.h</b></code> declaration file.
