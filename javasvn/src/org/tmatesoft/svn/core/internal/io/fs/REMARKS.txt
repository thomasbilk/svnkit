Remarks to the file:/// protocol implementation (FSRepository):

1) Pool for rev-nodes will surely optimize the methods run time

2) For now in update operations (when ignoring ancestry) when there's a need 
   to compare bytes of two files, I use ByteArrayOutputStream to fetch the file 
   contents first, i.e. the contents of files file1 and file2 are loaded into 
   the memory, what is not actually safe for huge files. But as I can guess 
   looking at the Subversion sources, they do the same (maybe I'm wrong?) when 
   applying a combined window and saving the result in a buffer, after what 
   they read portions of SVN_STREAM_CHUNK_SIZE (102400 bytes) from that 
   buffer. What I mean - they also store the full contents in the memory.
   I'm in a great doubt.
3) If it's true that in an FSFS repository a file may be represented with
   more than one diff window in a particular revision, it may cause a 
   trouble in getFile()? That is we'll have to keep the same source view 
   during applying those windows - now every next applying delta is 
   followed by replacing a previous source view with a previous target.
