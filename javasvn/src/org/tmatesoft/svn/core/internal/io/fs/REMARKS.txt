Remarks to the file:/// protocol implementation (FSRepository):

1) Pool for rev-nodes will surely optimize the methods run time 

   **SOLVED**

2) For now in update operations (when ignoring ancestry) when there's a need 
   to compare bytes of two files, I use ByteArrayOutputStream to fetch the file 
   contents first, i.e. the contents of files file1 and file2 are loaded into 
   the memory, what is not actually safe for huge files. But as I can guess 
   looking at the Subversion sources, they do the same (maybe I'm wrong?) when 
   applying a combined window and saving the result in a buffer, after what 
   they read portions of SVN_STREAM_CHUNK_SIZE (102400 bytes) from that 
   buffer. What I mean - they also store the full contents in the memory.
   I'm in a great doubt.
   
   - Now I'm writing all the contents to files - is it better, guess 
     not the ideal solution

3) If it's true that in an FSFS repository a file may be represented with
   more than one diff window in a particular revision, it may cause a 
   trouble in getFile()? That is we'll have to keep the same source view 
   during applying those windows - now every next applying delta is 
   followed by replacing a previous source view with a previous target.

4) I've noticed a problem with invoking a pre-revprop-change hook - 
   svn sucessfully manages to try an empty hook file, but in Java 
   Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd) failed to run an empty file - what's
   the problem? 
   
   **SOLVED**

5) It looks strange how delete_lock() works - why does it rewrite those
   files that haven't been changed? Why don't the svn devs make a break after 
   all interesting changes have been done? Whether there's a thing that I'm 
   not able to understand at now and there's a thing that prevents the devs 
   from breaking, or there's something they don't still know about:)
   
6) I've got big doubts on how the rev nodes pool is realized now. Should think
   of how to make it simplier and easier to use. The point is that now immutable
   rev-nodes are stored in the pool (at the first time each of them is 
   requested), but txn mutable rev-nodes are cached inside the FSRoot 
   representation for the txn root, - that is because we must not mix them 
   with immutable ones as it would cause plenty of problems and great confuse.
   SVN devs cache all rev-nodes in separate root representations, while we
   are doing that only for txns. Maybe I should leave it as it is and maybe 
   it's not an issue at all, since it's pretty handy to have a single pool for
   reading operations. Hmm.. We'll see what we shall see.

7) FSRepository.getFile() must be redone!!! It doesn't work correctly with huge |
   binary files (for example)!! Critical bug!                                   |
