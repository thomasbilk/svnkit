<B><SPAN CLASS="svnkit">SVNKit</SPAN><SUP>TM</SUP></B> - the only pure Java<SUP>TM</SUP> Subversion client library in the World.

<BR>
<!--<img src="SVNKit_API_Packages.jpg"></img>-->

<P>
<b>SVNKit</b><SUP>TM</SUP> is a powerful pure Java Subversion (SVN) client library. This means that users of the library, i.e. java applications 
do not have to include SVN native binaries or <i>javahl</i> bindings to work with a Subversion repository.
<P>
The library represents two main concepts for developers who use a Subversion repository in their projects:
<ul>
<li>Low-level API  - the package <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.io</b> - a solution for those developers who doesn't need to work with the native
Subversion high-level format known as <i>'Working Copy'</i> - that is when all local files are stored in a filesystem and all version controll 
metadata is concentrated in <i>.svn</i> directories. For instance, those developers who would like to customize managing versioned files - like
storing and managing versioned data as well as all metadata within a data base -
will certainly find this package pretty suitable for their purposes.       
</ul>
<ul>
<li>High-level API - the package <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.wc</b> - this is a set of classes and interfaces designed to provide developers means
for working particularly with the native Subversion client's format - <i>'Working Copy'</i>. All the commands supported by the SVN command line client can be 
also easily performed by using this high-level API. Obviously in those cases when an operation needs an access to a repository this high-level API 
uses the low-level one.
</ul>

<p> 
<h1>Features</h1>
 
Currently SVNKit supports the following repository access protocols:
<ul>
<li>
svn://, svn+ssh://
</li>
<li>
http://, https://
</li>
<li>file:/// (Since 1.1.0 and for FSFS-type repositories only)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Since 1.0.2</h4>
Support for error codes similar to error codes of the native SVN.

<h4>Since 1.1.0</h4>
<p>
Support for SVN 1.4 Working Copy format.

<p>
Administrative functionality: creation of local <b>FSFS</b>-type (Subversion compatible) 
repositories with the latest format version.
 
<p>
SVNKit also supports the native Subversion svnsync utility
functionality. At the same time SVNKit has its own engine to replicate 
revisions from one repository to another one. This allows to clone repositories even in those 
cases when a Subversion running server is too old and does not support synchronization 
functionality. Also repository replicator supports incremental mode: if you've copied a repository, 
then created some new revisions in it and would like to have them 
in your repository clone too, you do not need to copy the whole 
original repository again - you simply copy those missing revisions 
to the clone and it's up to date with the original one again!

<p>
svn+xxx:// URL schemes (not only svn+ssh). JavaSVN API gives a user an 
ability to define tunnel providers which are responsible for matching 
subprotocol names (xxx) to tunnel command lines.
