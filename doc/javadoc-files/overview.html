<B><SPAN CLASS="style0">JavaSVN</SPAN><SUP>TM</SUP></B> - the only pure Java<SUP>TM</SUP> Subversion client library in the World.

<P>
JavaSVN<SUP>TM</SUP> is a powerful pure java Subversion (<span class="style2"">SVN</span>) client library. This means that users of the library, i.e. java applications 
do not have to include <span class="style2">SVN</span> native binaries or <i>javahl</i> bindings to work with a Subversion repository.
<P>
The library represents two main concepts for developers who use a Subversion repository in their projects:
<ul>
<li>Low-level API  - the package <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.io</b> - a solution for those developers who doesn't need to work with the native
Subversion high-level format known as <i>'Working Copy'</i> - that is when all local files are stored in a filesystem and all version controll 
metadata is concentrated in <i>.svn</i> directories. For instance, those developers who would like to store their versioned files in data bases 
will certainly find this package pretty good for their purposes.       
</ul>
<ul>
<li>High-level API - the package <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.wc</b> - this is a set of classes and interfaces designed to provide developers means
for working particularly with the native Subversion format - <i>'Working Copy'</i>. All the commands supported by the <span class="style2"">SVN</span> command line client can be 
also easily performed by using this high-level API. Obviously in those cases when an operation needs an access to a repository this high-level API 
uses the low-level one.
</ul>
