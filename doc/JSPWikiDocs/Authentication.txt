!!!Authentication manager
When an anonymous access to a repository is not permitted, a server asks for authentication credentials. For these 
purposes __SVNKit__ uses authentication managers. Such managers implement the 
[ISVNAuthenticationManager | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/ISVNAuthenticationManager.html] 
interface. The [previous article | Getting Started With Svnkit] describes how to create an [SVNRepository | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/io/SVNRepository.html] 
driver for working with a repository. After such a driver has been instantiated you provide an authentication manager 
in the following way:

[{Java2HtmlPlugin 

       try {
            ...
            
            ISVNAuthenticationManager authManager;
            
            ...

            SVNURL url = SVNURL.parseURIDecoded( "svn://host/path_to_repository_root/inner_path" );
            SVNRepository repository = SVNRepositoryFactory.create( url , null );

            //set an auth manager which will provide user credentials
            repository.setAuthenticationManager(basicAuthManager);
   
            ...
            
       } catch (SVNException e) {
            //handle exception       		
       }

}]

If you don't provide an authentication manager and a server does not reject anonymous requests (for example, a server 
can be world-readable, and you are performing a checkout) everything should go well. But if it's not so and the server 
challenges you for credentials, you will certainly get an exception since there's no authentication manager provided.

!Authentication manager usage
The whole authentication manager is based on the following four logical blocks:

[{Image src = 'AuthManager_Architecture.png'  caption = 'Authentication Manager Architecture'}]

On the diagram each logical block is followed by a corresponding interface (in a bold font) provided within the [auth package | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/package-summary.html].
These blokcs are like pinions of a gear, in our case - of an authentication gear that is used within __SVNKit__. Such a 
structure allows you to replace different blocks while the authentication manager itself remaining the same. Let's look 
at those blocks closer.

!Authentication Provider
This block is represented by the [ISVNAuthenticationProvider | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/ISVNAuthenticationProvider.html] 
interface in __SVNKit__ authentication API. It's responsible for providing [user authentication credentials | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/SVNAuthentication.html] 
of different kinds. Such providers are passed to an authentication manager. Let's look at how __SVNKit__ acts when it receives a server 
challenge for authentication.

[{Image src = 'AuthProvider_In_Work.png'  caption = 'Authentication Provider In Work'}]

The above sequence diagram illustrates a commit process performed by __SVNKit__.
# A user initiates a commit request. __SVNKit__ sends the request to the server.
# The server receives the request and answers with a challenge for authentication.
# __SVNKit__ receives the server's challenge and asks the auth manager provided by the client for the first credentials. Here we assume that this is the first time credentials are requested, and since there can be probably more than one credentials for the same authentication realm, __SVNKit__ starts with the first credentials.
# The auth manager invokes its auth provider asking for the first credentials.
# The auth provider returns user credentials to the manager. In our example it prompts a user for login\password. However there can be other implementations: for example, a provider which fetches credentials from the standard Subversion auth storage. Actually, it's up to a user.
# The auth manager returns the credentials to the caller. Surely, this diagram is a bit relative: the auth manager (as well as auth provider) is also a part of __SVNKit__, but is shown separately only for more clear demonstration. 
# __SVNKit__ sends the request with credentials to the server.
# The server receives the credentials, checks them for validity. If the user is authorized seccessfully, the server carries out the request and sends back a response.
# So, if negotiation is successful __SVNKit__ says to the auth manager that the provided credentials have been acknowledged by the server. Then returns the control back to the caller.

But imagine, that the user has mistyped his password. 
# In this case the server rejects the credentials and challenges for authentication again. 
# __SVNKit__ receives an error message and says to the auth manager that the provided credentials are not acknowledged by the server. 
# Then __SVNKit__ asks the manager for the next credentials and the process described above repeats once again.

[{Image src = 'AuthProvider_In_Work_1.png' caption = 'Authentication Provider In Work'}]

__SVNKit__ keeps on asking the auth manager for the next credentials until either the server acknowledges some of them or the 
auth provider (hence the auth manager, too) runs out of credentials (returns ''null''). In the latter case __SVNKit__ throws an [SVNAuthenticationException | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/SVNAuthenticationException.html].

There may be more than one auth provider registered in the auth manager (like in the default auth manager implementation 
which is discussed later). Or maybe some wouldn't use providers at all, combining an auth manager and auth provider into 
a single class. It depends on a concrete implementation. 

!Kinds of authentication credentials
The following is a table of different kinds of auth credentials and subclasses of __SVNAuthentication__ which 
correspond to them:

||Kind||Class representation||Field of usage
|[PASSWORD | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/ISVNAuthenticationManager.html#PASSWORD]|[SVNPasswordAuthentication | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/SVNPasswordAuthentication.html]|''login:password'' authentication (''svn://'', ''http:// '')
|[SSH | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/ISVNAuthenticationManager.html#SSH]|[SVNSSHAuthentication | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/SVNSSHAuthentication.html]|In ''svn+ssh://'' tunneled connections
|[SSL | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/ISVNAuthenticationManager.html#SSL]|[SVNSSLAuthentication | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/SVNSSLAuthentication.html]|In secure ''https:// '' connections
|[USERNAME | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/ISVNAuthenticationManager.html#USERNAME]|[SVNUserNameAuthentication | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/SVNUserNameAuthentication.html]|With ''file:///'' protocol, on local machines

These kinds are provided by __SVNKit__ to the credentials-getter methods of an authentication manager. And an auth 
manager provides them to its auth provider. Those __SVNAuthentication__ instances which are returned back from an 
auth manager %%(color:red)must%% correspond to the kind passed. That means that, for example, if credentials of 
type __PASSWORD__ are requested, an auth manager must return an __SVNPasswordAuthentication__ object, and so on.

According to an access scheme __SVNKit__ passes an appropriate kind to an auth manager. For example, if ''svn+ssh://'' 
scheme is used, __SVNKit__ passes the __SSH__ kind to an auth manager.

!Authentication Storage
This block is represented by the [ISVNAuthenticationStorage | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/ISVNAuthenticationStorage.html] 
interface. __SVNKit__ implements this interface as a run-time in-memory storage for credentials of different kinds. In our previous example 
the auth provider can store login\password provided by the user in such a storage, so that later credentials (acknowledged by the server and stored in 
the run-time storage) may be reused without prompting the user again.

!Proxy Manager
If an authentication manager provides a non-null [proxy manager | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/ISVNProxyManager.html], 
__SVNKit__ interacts with a target server through a proxy server represented by the proxy manager.

!SSL Manager
This block is represented by the [ISVNSSLManager | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/ISVNSSLManager.html] 
interface. When a secured http connection is used (''https:// ''), and this manager is not ''null'', it's used by 
__SVNKit__ to create SSL encrypted sockets (i.e. such a manager provides an appropriate SSL context). However if 
no SSL manager is provided by an auth manager, __SVNKit__ uses a default one which, of course, knows nothing of 
user certificate files. But this default one will provide an SSL context for creating SSL sockets as well as receive 
server certificate file.

!!!Default ISVNAuthenticationManager implementations
__SVNKit__ provides the following implementations of __ISVNAuthenticationManager__:
* [BasicAuthenticationManager | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/auth/BasicAuthenticationManager.html]
* DefaultSVNAuthenticationManager

!DefaultSVNAuthenticationManager
This implementation has the following features:
* Can use an on-disk auth storage located in the [default Subversion run-time configuration are | http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.html#svn.advanced.confarea] or in a specified directory. It's able to cache credentials in that directory.
* Uses a run-time in-memory storage for credentials __(ISVNAuthenticationStorage__ implementation).
* Can authenticate a user with provided name\password credentials.
* Uses SSL, SSH, proxy settings from the ''config'' and ''servers'' files found in the default Subversion run-time configuration area.

On Windows machines name\password credentials are often stored encrypted. Unfortunately, __SVNKit__ is not able to 
decrypt such credentials, therefore they are not used (just skipped).

The class which is responsible for instantiating __DefaultSVNAuthenticationManager__ objects is [SVNWCUtil | http://svnkit.com/kb/javadoc/org/tmatesoft/svn/core/wc/SVNWCUtil.html].

!BasicAuthenticationManager
This is another very simple implementation of __ISVNAuthenticationManager__. Its has got the following features:
* Does not use an on-disk auth storage.
* Does not provide any SSL manager.
* Does not use any settings from the ''config'' and ''servers'' files mentioned above.
* Uses proxy, ssh settings and user credentials provided into the class constructors, i.e. does not use authentication providers at all.
* Does not cache credentials at all.

You may provide an array of different __SVNAuthentication__ credentials, your own specific proxy and ssh settings to 
such an auth manager and then use it in __SVNKit__.

!!!Forcing authentication
Although one of the Subversion advantages is that you do not need to authenticate yourself until a server challenges 
you, sometimes it may be effective to have an ability to make __SVNKit__ immediately authenticate a user without 
wasting time. The __ISVNAuthenticationManager__ interface provides this ability: it returns a flag which __SVNKit__ 
uses to control such a behaviour.

!!!HTTP authentication schemes
__SVNKit__ supports the following http auth schemes (for both server and proxy authentication):
* Basic
* Digest
* NTLM

For Basic and Digest schemes you provide a login name and a password. Like this:

[{Java2HtmlPlugin 
       
       ...
            
       ISVNAuthenticationManager authManager = new BasicAuthenticationManager( "login" ,  "password" );
       
       ...

}]

In the NTLM auth scheme you also provide a domain name:

[{Java2HtmlPlugin 

       ...
            
       ISVNAuthenticationManager authManager = new BasicAuthenticationManager( "DOMAIN\\login" ,  "password" );
       
       ...

}]
