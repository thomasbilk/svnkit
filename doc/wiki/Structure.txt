   | + 'Managing a Subversion repository with JavaSVN'
   | Description:
   |             Devides all operations into 2 groups: reading ones and modifying (editing) ones. 
   |             When telling about the second group - editing operations (not including revprops
   |             and locks) the article smoothly comes to ISVNEditor (why editor and what for) in description.
   |             Here it says that commiting (editing) operations are the following (repository-side):
   |             commit, copy, move, delete, import, mkdir - all are driven by an ISVNEditor returned by 
   |             an SVNRepository driver. Then below a list of links to artcles describing some operations 
   |             implemented by JavaSVN follows.
